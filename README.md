# KalshiBags

**Confidence-Triggered Token Launch Platform**

KalshiBags is an innovative platform that automatically mints cryptocurrency tokens when real-world event probabilities cross predefined confidence thresholds. By integrating with Kalshi prediction markets and the Bags API, KalshiBags creates a data-driven approach to token creation that prevents spam and ensures meaningful launches.

## 🎯 Project Idea

### The Problem

Traditional token launches often suffer from:
- **Spam tokens**: Low-quality tokens created without meaningful signals
- **Lack of transparency**: No verifiable data backing token creation
- **Manual processes**: Time-consuming and inefficient token launch workflows

### The Solution

KalshiBags solves these problems by creating an automated, signal-based token minting system:

> **"When confidence crosses a threshold, a token is born."**

The platform continuously monitors Kalshi probability markets for various events and predictions. When the confidence (probability) for a specific event crosses a predefined threshold (e.g., 70%), tokens are automatically minted via the Bags API.

### Example

When the probability of **"US recession in 2025"** exceeds **70%** on Kalshi, the **$RECESSION25** token is automatically minted via Bags, creating a transparent and verifiable token launch backed by real market data.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Signal-Based Minting
Tokens are created only when real-world events reach significant confidence thresholds, ensuring meaningful launches with genuine market signals.

### 2. Spam Prevention
Automatic filtering through probability thresholds means only tokens with genuine market signals are created, preventing low-quality token spam.

### 3. Data-Driven Launches
Every token launch is backed by real market data from Kalshi, creating transparent and verifiable token creation that users can trust.

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
Continuous tracking of probability markets ensures immediate token creation when thresholds are crossed.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Monitor Kalshi**
   - Continuously track probability markets on Kalshi for various events and predictions

2. **Threshold Detection**
   - When confidence crosses a predefined threshold (e.g., 70%), the system triggers token creation

3. **Auto-Mint via Bags**
   - Tokens are automatically minted using the Bags API, creating a seamless launch process

4. **Token Trading**
   - Users can view active tokens, track their performance, and purchase tokens directly from the platform (coming soon)
